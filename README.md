# AMMI_BootCamp_Week_1
This repository contains all jobs for week 1 of bootcamp. The main paper is <a href= 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01365.pdf'> Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks </a>.

The main idea behind this paper is to identify how much an inputs feature (pixels, for example) contribute to the prediction of a given input data (image for example). This is very important for the model interpretability. The method that we use is <b> Integrated gradient</b>.
